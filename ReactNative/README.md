You can select any one of the stories mentioned in the [stories](../stories/) folder, and develop a React Native webapp for it.


### Instructions

*   API: 
    *   Create stubs based on the user story selected
    *   Mock those stubs (an easy way to do this is to use Postman)
    *   Integrate with the mock stubs
*   View: 
    *   Design reusable components that are used across all the screens relevant
    *   Include any collateral/stock images (make sure these are okay for public use)
    *   Include icons/vector art wherever relevant
*   State Management: 
    *   Use redux for state management
    *   thunk/saga for middleware
*   Routing: Use React Navigation
 

### Assessment Criteria
1. Maintainability and organisation of code 
2. Usage of
    1. Redux for state management
    2. Saga/Thunk for middleware
    3. UI Component libraries
3. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges.
If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.  
4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product.
For a React Native dev, this could translate to: 
    1. creating mocks from the API documentation
    2. adding icons/collateral 
5. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project
6. [Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17) for clean commit messages
