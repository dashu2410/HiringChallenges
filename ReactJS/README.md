If you haven't received any communication from Wealth42 to complete a specific assessment, you are expected to do the project described in general_assessment.md  

### Assessment Criteria
1. Maintainability and organisation of code 
2. Usage of
    1. Redux for state management
    2. Saga/Thunk for middleware
    3. UI Component libraries
3. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges.
If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.  
4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product.
For a ReactJS dev, this could translate to: 
    1. creating mocks from the API documentation
    2. adding icons/collateral 
5. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project
6. Homogeneity of commits - All commits should only be addressing one particular issue/feature, which is highlighted clearly in the commit message. This does not imply that all commits need to be small.
